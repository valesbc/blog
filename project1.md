![Wine Bottles](https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8202/8285272446_3887c60dca.jpg)

For the second assigment of Obsertional Drawing I need to draw three bottles (of wine) one farther away from the other and overlaping 2 of those bottles.
The drawing has to be made with charcoal pencils and charchoal vine. This assigments helps to understand proportions with different objects as well as how to use line quality and value of contrast to create form and depth.
The light source has to come from either the left or right side.
