This logo was created using the lower case letter p by the Garamond typography. 
I wanted to make a simple design but still playing with the letters.
Not focusing on creating a form geometrical or just a symetrical but keeping it as simple as possible.
Keeping two letters in white and two letters gave it balance and allowed the letter to be recognizable.
