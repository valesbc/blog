tiny tutorial over here!

The common use for Photoshop is to edit images, covert them into vectors, collages, etc. But not everybody knows how to Illustrated directly in Photoshop. Which is actually very very easy!. Please keep in mind that this tutorial is for people that already have some very basic knowledge of the program. If you've never even open Photoshop this might be too hard to understand. With that been said
Here is a step by step tutorial on how to illustrate in Photoshop:

Step 1. Before opening Photoshop or your computer. You should draw you illustration in black ink by hand and scan it. Sakura pencils are great for this. Or any typo of black ink pencil. Here is how it should look:

The lines should be a solid black so Photoshop can identified it as one color.

Step 2. Scan your drawing. Open it in Photoshop

Step 3. You have to covert your image into a layer: You can do this by doble clicking it and hitting ok.

Step 4. Take out the white background: The most common way is by using the magic wand tool. But this becomes unpractical because you would have to select everysingle white space. An easy way to do this is to go to Select > Color Range > Select the white > put Fuzziness in 200 > hit Ok > hit delete.

Step 5. Background: Now that we have our drawing as a vector now we need a background. You hit create new layer. That new layer put it below you drawing and paint it white with the paint bucket tool.

Step 6. Adding color: To add you would want to do it not on top of your "linea" layer but below. So now we have to organize our layers. We are going to create a folder. To this you hit the little folder icon called "create group". You put it a name in this case "skin" and inside that folder you creat another layer. Between your drawing and your background. This is very important cause usually an illustrator uses around 300-400 folders sometimes and in order to make changes this is an easier way to know where to go to change what.
