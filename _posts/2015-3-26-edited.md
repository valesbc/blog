MIAMI BEACH, Fla. — On a recent afternoon, Scott McKenzie watched torrential rains and a murky tide swallow the street outside his dog-grooming salon. Within minutes, much of this stretch of chic South Beach was flooded ankle-deep in a fetid mix of rain and sea.
>“Welcome to the new Venice,” Scott McKenzie joked as salt water surged from the sewers.

There are few places in the nation more vulnerable to rising sea levels than low-lying South Florida, a tourist and retirement mecca built on drained swampland.

>“This is not a future problem. It’s a current problem,” 
said Leonard Berry,  director of the Florida Center for Environmental Studies at Florida Atlantic University 
and a contributing author of the National Climate Assessment, 
which found that sea levels have risen about 8 inches in the past century.

*Miami Beach is expected to spend $400 million on an elaborate pumping system to cope with routine flooding.* 
To the north, Fort Lauderdale has shelled out millions to restore beaches 
and a section of coastal highway after Hurricane Sandy and other storms breached the city’s concrete sea wall. 
Hallandale Beach, which lies on the Atlantic Coast between the two cities,
has abandoned six of its eight drinking water wells because of encroaching seawater.

By one regional assessment, *the waters off South Florida could rise another 2 feet by 2060,*
a scenario that would overwhelm the region’s aging drainage system and taint its sources of drinking water.

>“It’s getting to the point where some properties being bought today will probably not be able to be sold at the end of a 30-year mortgage,” 
said Harold Wanless, chairman of the geological sciences department at University of Miami. 
“You would think responsible leaders and responsible governments would take that as a wake-up call.”

Among the chief skeptics are:

- U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio 
- former Gov. Jeb Bush
- Gov. Rick Scot (who is running for re-election) 

Them and other Republicans warn against what they see as alarmist policies that could derail the country’s tenuous economic recovery.

Their positions could affect their political fortunes.

Democrats plan to place climate change, and the GOP’s skepticism, 
front and center in a state where the issue is no longer an abstraction.

Their hope is to win over independents and siphon some Republicans, who are deeply divided over global warming. Tom Steyer, a billionaire environmental activist, has pledged to spend $100 million this year to influence seven critical contests nationwide, including the Florida governor’s race.

>“They don’t believe in science. That’s ridiculous,” Democrat Charlie Crist said at a recent campaign rally in Miami. “This is ground zero for climate change in America.”

Nationally, the issue could prove tricky for Democrats.

Polls show a bipartisan majority of Americans favor measures to reduce planet-warming greenhouse gases, 
such as the new federal rule to limit carbon emissions from power plants.
But they routinely rank climate change far behind the economy, the centerpiece of Scott’s campaign, 
when prioritizing issues.
Meanwhile, Miami Beach is bracing for another season of punishing tides.

>“We’re suffering while everyone is arguing man-made or natural,” said Christine Florez, 
president of the West Avenue Corridor Neighborhood Association. 
“We should be working together to find solutions so people don’t feel like they’ve been left on a log drifting out to sea.”
