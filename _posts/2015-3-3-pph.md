title: Can spoken word poetry make a difference?
---

Spoken word poetry is the art of performance poetry. It is poetry that is a combination of theater, story-telling and wordplay. This type of poetry needs to be heard out loud or witnessed in person. Spoken word poetry has been used for centuries from the ancient Greeks in their political and social discourse to Dr. Martin Luther King's famous speech "I have a dream." It also originated from blue's music and the 1960s beatniks. Now this art form is being associated with both the feminist and 
LGBT movement, as well as addressing other social problems. Spoken word poetry allows a connection between the poet and the audience by giving them the opportunity to express experiences and opinions publicly and allows for an immediate connection. Also there are many spoken word poetry competitions called poetry "slams" that are very common among young people. The following video is a perfect example of the power of spoken word poetry. This poetry slam is from a non profit organization called Get Lit. This one is called ["Rape Joke'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4m3AJamQYM). Another very heartbreaking, outstanding poem that was shown on national TV is called ["Somewhere in America"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YshUDa10JYY).

Because there is not much spoken word poetry being transmitted on TV, poets like Sarah Kay used Youtube and TED talks to show and explain this art and their poetic and theatrical abilities. The debut of Sarah Kay's TED talk in California, with her new poems "B" and "Hiroshima" were graced with two standing ovations. This talk is called ["If I should have a daughter..."](http://www.ted.com/playlists/87/spoken_word_fireworks) Please take a moment to watch. 

Videos like this traveling through the web are very touching and powerful. This form is perfect for speaking up, expressing yourself and getting through to people directly. For me Sarah Kay's videos  make a difference and I believe that they are just as effective as Martin Luther King's speech was. Spoken word poetry can help reach out to society and address its current problems.
