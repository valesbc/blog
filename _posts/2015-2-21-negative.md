title: The usefulness of the negative space 
---


Negative space is the space around and between the subjects of an image. Quite simple right?
Well the negative space can be just as import as the object itself. Negative space brings balance to a composition and if done well crosses the boundaries of positive space.


A lot of artists nowadays are emerging and focusing on creating positive shapes and shapes that, in turn, in a very cleaver way form out shapes in negative space intentionally.
Of course we have seen it done in logos many times. 
Just the famous Fedex logo has a an arrow between the e and the x.

But when it comes to drawing negative space can be very helpful. For example when we are drawing a complex object or subject maybe the human body. Depending on the pose and angle sometimes things get distorted and sometimes is easier to draw the space around the object than the object itself.

For people who have been drawing for a while doing an exercise such as this one:

Drawing the negative space around a dinning set, can be quite difficult. For me it was. My brain kept insisting un drawing the whole table instead of the spaces around and between it. But it’s quite a powerful state and drawing when you get to just shut off that part of your brain and only looking at the spaces.

Also never be afraid to play with negative space for a picture or a logo. Here I will put a few examples along with their link to the sources. 
But as you can see sometimes just that empty space can say a thousand words more than just a bunch of object. It would look good but it cause the same impact as the negative spaces. 
Sometimes we even see the negative space being use but we don’t identified, not even right away, but you know it’s there cause something looks odd. 
Negative space by itself is a form of art not everyone can get such good design by using this same technique.
