In case you missed the first post and don't know what I'm talking about you can go to my previous post in February 
[Pop Show à la Art Nouveau](http://valesbc.me/artnouveau/). Since then I few things changed.

My team and I decided to not go overboard with the art nouveau style and instead give it a modern twist. As the only Graphic Designer with Web concentration in my group I was left with the work for all The Social Media (Website, mobile app, banners)
The only art nouveau I used was just for the font (Lucida Blackletter) which fitted perfectly. This were the final one that are going for my final project.
