Art Nouveau is a style of art that was most popular during 1890–1910 is literally french for “new art”.
The typefaces are very fluid, curve lines, and most poster well almost every poster of Art Nouveau features a female as a main subject. The style is also very gypsy like. 
No doubt a challenge. Even though we were allowed to choose present singers we could also choose artists like Mozart. 

My team choose two pop stars: Madonna & Lady Gaga. 

The fun part about this, is that while 98% of my team is compose by graphic designers, we also got 2 advertisers. We have to think about everything including, locations, tickets, web design, logo, banners, shirts, CD’s, the public we are referring to. Basically everything. 
While Art Nouveau is a very old classic art style . It’s quite beautiful. 
And of course this two divas are know for being chameleons so even that old classic style for a big show of both them it doesn’t look so weird.
 We had trouble picking names and slogans but right now the name of the show will be “The Royal Show” Long Live the queen.

The only colors are going to be Black, white and gold.
The logo is supposed to be a crown or a royal shield. (not yet finished)

My part of course if the web design part as well of bracelets and headbands.

Right now we have the main ideas, along with a poster, a posible mural, t- shirt design for men and women and the crown for the logo.

Because this two superstars have always had this competition between them. That’s were the show came together. The crown we choose it plays along with the religious symbolism. Because of course, this to ladies have the tendency of throwing the bible out of the window. 

The promotion would start a year maybe year and a half in advanced since is supposed to be the concert of the century taking place in Paris, France on 2016 in plain street.
