And is a project consisting of on the presentation of nine plays each lasting 15 minutes inside of a decorated container in which the maximum fit is approximately of 15 people. This way the audience is integrated directly with the actors. The nine plays are perform six times every evening in continuous sessions from Thursday to Saturdays from 8pm to 11pm and Sundays from 6pm to 9 pm.
