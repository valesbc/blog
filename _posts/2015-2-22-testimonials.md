"I like the way Valeria Becerra's writing seek to get the attention of the public with the headlines. Also by including design in everyday life so people will take it seriously and appreciate its importance and potential. I felt represented in the Studying Abroad Etiquette articule. She talks about interesting subjects that we don't think about very often but they are importan when are introduce to us. I wouldn't doubt on recommending this blog or Valeria Becerra as a graphic designer because she works with a lot of passion and has a great imagination that is perfectly represented in the works and drawings of her blog." -Ana Capote, Venezuelan english student in New York City.
