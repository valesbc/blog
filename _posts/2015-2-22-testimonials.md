"I like the way Valeria Becerra's writing seek to get the attention of the public with the headlines. Also by including design in everyday life so people will take it seriously and appreciate its importance and potential. I felt represented in the Studying Abroad Etiquette articule. She talks about interesting subjects that we don't think about very often but they are importan when are introduce to us. I wouldn't doubt on recommending this blog or Valeria Becerra as a graphic designer because she works with a lot of passion and has a great imagination that is perfectly represented in the works and drawings of her blog." -Ana Capote, english student in New York City. 

"This website is illustrative, sassy, honest, funny, totally innovative, definitely a diamond in the rough, a rising star" - Yisbel Pe√±a Times

"I really like what Valeria has done here. The design of the page is great; a simple white background that makes everything else pop out. The headlines of her post are so interesting they make you want to read the whole post. Everything is well written so it's easy to read and understand. While reading, I learned a few things such as how to use negative space in drawings. Also, her art is very good and I am sure she will get even better as time goes on. I would recommend Valeria as a graphic designer any day of the week. She is pretty talented and a hard worker as well."- Envoy Bodden
