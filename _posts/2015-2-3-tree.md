*Learning cross contour study the good and the bad.*

Just when you think you’re finally understanding the subject. You find yourself feeling even more confuse. 
From finally understanding and getting used to square shapes, cylinders, shading and contrast. 
My dear professor throughs a tree trunks and the explanation of cross contour study. Cross Contour study means mapping the surface of an object to understand its mass. 
With that being said I find it equally difficult and easier. Easier because you don’t have to measure every single inch of the object, it’s not man made so you just follow the shape and it’s a little more freeing. 
Difficult because mapping out it’s surface if done fast can’t look distort, as well as changing the pressure of the pencil in each line to add contrast and value to the object. And still stepping back just to make sure that the proportions were looking ok.
Either way, after a lot of erasing (even more than actually drawing) and a lot of asking and consulting I was able to come up with a decent looking tree trunk. 
Hopefully my homework can look just as good specially with a few shading added in strategic places.
