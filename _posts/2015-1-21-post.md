As Frank Chimero once said
>“Good design is all about making other designers feel like idiots because that idea wasn’t theirs.”

After a week and a half of studying Graphic Design. It feels exactly like this.
One has absolutely no idea how much thought goes into a very simple design that ironically the concept sometimes can be very complex. 
From getting the right proportion of a wine bottle to mixing letters to create a geometrical logo to making articles and putting codes for every image, link, space, quote and so on. 
It’s a very fun and interesting career with a very large field of work, especially with social media. The fact that absolutely everything no matter how small or large or weird can be design fascinates me. Especially when as a student they push you to look at things from a totally different perspective with no restrictions just a few requirements.

Going from high school, the regular educational system that pretty much encases you creatively. 
To go from that to this wonderful madness can be a quite overwhelming. But going a little insane is just part of the process.
Here are some truths about being a graphic design student:
