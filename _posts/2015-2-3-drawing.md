title: FOR THOSE STRUGGLING WITH OBSERVATIONAL DRAWING, HERE ARE A FEW TIPS TO HELP YOU WITH PROPORTIONS AND ADDING VALUE.
---

*Turning a 3 dimensional figure or object into a 2 dimensional drawing is no piece of cake. It takes a lot of time and a lot of presicion.
It’s easy to get incredibly frustrated if you don’t follow this very simple tips.*

Each one takes time but the overall result is worth it.
Here I explain them in 2 parts Proportion and Contrast and Value.

**Proportion:** 
First of all I suggest you used your pencil as a guidance to measure your objects and there sizes according to each other.
Very light strokes since this is the part where for example I usually erase more than what I draw.  After you have draw every object, take a step back, look elsewhere and take another look at your drawing. 
After long periods of time looking at an object we might distort things instead of drawing them as they actually are. Please remember to be patient and have in mind this is going to take a while, some of my classmates take about 2-3 hours. 
I on the other hand take around 5 and sometimes I even have draw it twice. 
The important thing here is to always take a moment to check your measurements and see if you like and actually looks like the 3 dimensional objects. 
After you are completely sure all the object sizes are good. Now you can start adding value.
 
**Contrats and Value:**
Here is where shading comes in. My professor taught a very simple and kind of silly method to localize the light source (lightest area) and the darkest areas which is basically squinting your eyes. 
That way is more clear where the contrast of your objects are. If you are drawing more than one and this happens to be closer to you then the other remember that the one closest to you is gonna have more detail and shaper lines as opposed to the one farther away from you which is going to have lighter line and much less details. Don’t be afraid to use charcoal and a lot of it for the very dark areas remember that helps give your object that 3D effect. For the parts with the most light use an eraser in case you want to emphasize it even more just add a dark shade in the background to make it pop.  I consider shading to be an art by itself. After you have that cover check to see if the contrast between your objects is correct. There is a technique that my professor taught me (which I’m still learning) in which you take your thumb and your index finger and make a little circle with them and look through them back and forward from your 3d objects to your drawing and see the difference in contrast. It’s not easy to see at first but the more you practice the easier it gets.
