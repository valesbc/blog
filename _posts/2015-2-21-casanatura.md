Me and a group of classmate had the opportunity of using and testing this really nice, eco friendly cleaning product called
Nana’s Good For All – All Purpose Cleaner from Casanatura.

First things first, Casanatura is an eco friendly company base in the USA. All of their products are ammonia free and non toxic.
With that being said lets talk about the benefits.

Good things:


* Non toxic

* Ammonia Free

* 100% Biodegradable

* No Harsh Chemicals

* Clean Scent derived from plant and mineral based ingredients

* No Animal - by- products; eliminating residue

* Fragrance Free

* Made in USA

This product is for all you animal lovers, and for people who likes planet earth and would like to make it less
contaminated and gross and at the same time keeping everything clean and non toxic. As well as for people 
with a sensitive nose or with allergies. 

We tested this product on a shoe, a board and a MacBook. It clean them pretty nice, no smell at all, or damage to either one of those 
things. 

Just this bottle can clean almost any surface including:

- porcelain

- aluminum 

- stainless steel 

- upholstery 

There's no need to carry or have a bunch of products for specifics products this pretty much covers them all. 
No need of steping out of room you just clean because the smell is so strong you either start sneezing, get a headache or
unintentionally get high. Besides of not contributing to any type of enviromental contamination.

This all purpose cleaner comes in a plastic spray bottles, medium size. Pretty confortable to carry it around the house. 
The spray has security lock that works by just turning the tip to close or open. Just spray the product anywhere you want to clean
and wipe it out, done!. 

Like any product it has some downsides:

* You need to spray and wipe at least 2 times for it to properly clean 
* The company has no money back guarantee or return policy
* It's not sold anywhere or eveywhere
* Prevents the growth of bacteria but doesnt kill it once is already there.

This product is entirely made in the USA. The price is arounf 3.80$. And one of the store this company provides their products to 
in Florida is Sedano's Supermarket.
With this product you are basically purchasing something that it's gonna help you keep everything clean effectively, without harming you, your family or your environment.
