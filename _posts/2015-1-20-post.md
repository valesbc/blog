title: Feminism vs Meninism
---



There’s this new trend call Meninism which is basically a movement leader by men taking a stand against Feminism (more about it) here: http://www.buzzfeed.com/rossalynwarren/men-are-calling-themselves-meninists-to-take-a-stand-against
Feminism tends to be a bad word which it doesn’t make sense. Meninism as a movement is a complete joke. 

“ Feminist: the person who believes in the social
Political, and economic equality of the sexes” - Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie

Key words are equality of the sexes. Why is this so hard to understand? Women have being discriminated and yes this movements focuses more on women issues but it doesn’t neglect the male problems as well. Feminism is just the wild idea that women are people. Men suffer too from the lack of compassion and understanding of our society, the thing about feminism not taken seriously is just the population of women that are oppressed by society is larger or at least more obvious is larger than the male. People just need to educate themselves more about what feminism stands for. It worries me that this so called men in the “movement of Meninism” have moms, grandmothers, sisters, daughters, girlfriends and wives and still they don’t care to acknowledge their struggle and instead just make fun of it. And just doesn’t help at all to actually take in consideration if their issues are being neglected in Feminism. I really hope this is all an act of ignorance. Just as a lot people when they are asked if they are feminist and say no but say they believe in the equally of the sexes. Maybe they just don’t understand how words work.
