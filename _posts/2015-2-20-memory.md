Memory can be a tricky little…. thing. We can remember the smallest most meaningless detail just by looking at it once. But spending the whole day studying for an exam just to get there and barely being able to remember your own name.Or worst, remembering you forgot something but not being able to remember what it was. Here’s the thing for the majority of just the 95% of the populations that doesn’t have an eidetic memory (photographic memory). A few tips, tricks or whatever you like to call it can really be helpful. From studying a few hours before an exam to remembering how to get places. Nothing new for most people, maybe a few things you forgot about. Anyway here are 5 little ways to encode information to that beautiful brain of yours:

I’m about to blow your mind. Ready?

1. Rehearsal. Yes thats right. you’ve never heard it before, but actually rehearsing and repeating over and over again an action or reading/ hearing information can actually make you remember it or even get better at it. 

2. Visual encoding. This means linking information to visual pictures of any type. For example: Saying to somebody DON’T SMOKE would probably won’t have the same effect as showing someone the results of their smoking. That’s why those tv commercial are so graphic, and it works pretty well.

3. Encoding information through Chunking. sounds funny but actually works. for example you have to remember a set of numbers let say, 1776149218121941. If you are knowledgeable about American history then you might recall them better this way: 1776 1492 1812 1941. 

4. Chunking with Acronyms. 
Acronyms are really easy way of remembering information and even works for remembering information in a certain order. Each letter of an acronym represents the information to be remembered.
HOMES= Huron, Ontario, Michigan, Erie, Superior
ROY G BIV= Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Indigo, Violet.

5. Remebering information in a Hierarchy. You can remember complex information if you simplify it and subdivided into categories and subcategories. Example:
