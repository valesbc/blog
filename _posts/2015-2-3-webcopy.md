title: WHY KNOWING HOW TO WRITE WEB COPY IS IMPORTANT FOR GRAPHIC DESIGN?
---


*Breaking it down as simple as possible.* 

As [Jeffrey Zeldman](http://www.zeldman.com/2008/05/06/content-precedes-design/) said 
> “Content precedes design. Design in the absence of content is not design, it’s decoration.”  

The regular users (meaning your possible clients) see your web site as a whole, not just the design not just the text but everything as an single item which they’ll decide whether they like it or not. 
Your design has a meaning and a reason (or it’s supposed to) as to why you decide to present certain subject or theme like that. As a graphic designer you need to be able to explain your work and sell it. 
Specially were almost the entire fiel depends and works on the web. Unless design is just a hobby for you then don’t worry about not knowing the first rules of effective web copy. But if it’s not the case you need to dedicate the time to writing on your web site. As much or maybe just 3 quarters of the time you spend uploading your work and making your web site look great to actually writing the content properly. This will help you to effectively get more clients and a bigger audience since your entire web site is focus on communicating your main message.
