title: MORE DOESN’T MEAN BETTER. SIMPLICITY CAN’T BE EVEN MORE CHALLENGING TO DESIGN.

*HERE IS MY PERSONAL EXPERIENCE WITH REQUIREMENTS AND FREE WILL IN THE CREATIVE PROCESS.*

Going from my professor dictating the sizes, the font and the colors I’m allowed to use to being able to create my own font, size and as many colors as I want.
Simplicity doesn’t come easy to me. I always feel like something is missing than I remember just because is something is simple doesn’t mean it has to be boring.
Typography is a big part of graphic design. In this class my client is my professor. Being able to be creative with no limitations is as important as being creative with certain requirements. 
In the last assignment, the only requirements I was told were the type face called Optima, the phrases I had to use and the size of the design. The rest as to color, arranging the letters, making them bigger or smaller it didn’t matter as long as it was readable.
I went from just using 2-3 colors for one design to doing a tie-dye effect and turning a word into an eye for another one. I love both and I’m starting to learn that requirements don’t have to mean limitations but more as to another way to look at things. 
For the most recent assignment I’m even allowed to create my own type face and I’ve never taking so long to actually start drawing. The possibilities were endless. But after I actually draw about a million different things I realize less is more and that if there is too much going on it gets tiring to see instead of just looking clean and understandable
