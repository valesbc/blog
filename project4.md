The next logo was created by using the lower case letter p of Bookman Medium typography. 
The concept was to try to make letter p fit it self or hock to it self and still create a geometrical form. The best way was to just turn it around. By leaving some spaces in white or blank you can see the creations on each interception and still reconized the letter by it self.
